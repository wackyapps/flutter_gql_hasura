Fetching ka control is available to front end developer
Because front end developer is making UI's and he /she know 
which UI needs what data and how to manage the response of that data
as per the UI requirements.


Over Fetching 

books 
    authors
        address


Under Fetching
    books List<Book>
    item tap => id new UI par Book Detail Future<Book>

    GraphQL can be called from Front End and Server Side End both. 
    When business logic needed to be executed in long running tasks, then we can call gql on server side as well.
